# Universal Identifiers

> [!note]
> A collection of identifiers used in the context of TCP/IP connections to identify endpoints in a _universal communication service_, or a service that allows and host on it to communicate with any other host.

## Classification

Host identifiers can be classified under the following categories:

1. Names
2. [[Internet Protocol Address|Addresses]]
3. Routes

Generally, a _name_ identifies _what_ an object is, an _address_ identifies _where_ an object is, and a _route_ describes how to get there.
